### Examples Using AUTO_INCREMENT


The `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute can be used to generate a unique identity for new rows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE animals (
     id MEDIUMINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
     name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
     PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

INSERT INTO animals (name) VALUES
    ('dog'),('cat'),('penguin'),
    ('lax'),('whale'),('ostrich');

SELECT * FROM animals;
```

Which returns:

```none
+----+---------+
| id | name    |
+----+---------+
|  1 | dog     |
|  2 | cat     |
|  3 | penguin |
|  4 | lax     |
|  5 | whale   |
|  6 | ostrich |
+----+---------+
```

No value was specified for the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column, so MySQL assigned sequence numbers automatically. You can also explicitly assign 0 to the column to generate sequence numbers, unless the [`NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_auto_value_on_zero) SQL mode is enabled. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO animals (id,name) VALUES(0,'groundhog');
```

If the column is declared `NOT NULL`, it is also possible to assign `NULL` to the column to generate sequence numbers. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO animals (id,name) VALUES(NULL,'squirrel');
```

When you insert any other value into an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column, the column is set to that value and the sequence is reset so that the next automatically generated value follows sequentially from the largest column value. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO animals (id,name) VALUES(100,'rabbit');
INSERT INTO animals (id,name) VALUES(NULL,'mouse');
SELECT * FROM animals;
+-----+-----------+
| id  | name      |
+-----+-----------+
|   1 | dog       |
|   2 | cat       |
|   3 | penguin   |
|   4 | lax       |
|   5 | whale     |
|   6 | ostrich   |
|   7 | groundhog |
|   8 | squirrel  |
| 100 | rabbit    |
| 101 | mouse     |
+-----+-----------+
```

Updating an existing `AUTO_INCREMENT` column value in an `InnoDB` table does not reset the `AUTO_INCREMENT` sequence as it does for `MyISAM` and `NDB` tables.

You can retrieve the most recent automatically generated `AUTO_INCREMENT` value with the [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/information-functions.html#function_last-insert-id) SQL function or the [`mysql_insert_id()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/5.6/en/mysql-insert-id.html) C API function. These functions are connection-specific, so their return values are not affected by another connection which is also performing inserts.

Use the smallest integer data type for the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column that is large enough to hold the maximum sequence value you will need. When the column reaches the upper limit of the data type, the next attempt to generate a sequence number fails. Use the `UNSIGNED` attribute if possible to allow a greater range. For example, if you use [`TINYINT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/integer-types.html), the maximum permissible sequence number is 127. For [`TINYINT UNSIGNED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/integer-types.html), the maximum is 255. See [Section 11.1.2, “Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/integer-types.html) for the ranges of all the integer types.

Note

For a multiple-row insert, [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/information-functions.html#function_last-insert-id) and [`mysql_insert_id()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/5.6/en/mysql-insert-id.html) actually return the `AUTO_INCREMENT` key from the *first* of the inserted rows. This enables multiple-row inserts to be reproduced correctly on other servers in a replication setup.

To start with an `AUTO_INCREMENT` value other than 1, set that value with [`CREATE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/create-table.html) or [`ALTER TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/alter-table.html), like this:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE tbl AUTO_INCREMENT = 100;
```

### AUTO_INCREMENT Handling in InnoDB

### InnoDB中的AUTO_INCREMENT处理机制


`InnoDB` provides a configurable locking mechanism that can significantly improve scalability and performance of SQL statements that add rows to tables with `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns. To use the `AUTO_INCREMENT` mechanism with an `InnoDB` table, an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column must be defined as part of an index such that it is possible to perform the equivalent of an indexed `SELECT MAX(*`ai_col`*)` lookup on the table to obtain the maximum column value. Typically, this is achieved by making the column the first column of some table index.

This section describes the behavior of `AUTO_INCREMENT` lock modes, usage implications for different `AUTO_INCREMENT` lock mode settings, and how `InnoDB` initializes the `AUTO_INCREMENT` counter.



##### InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT Lock Modes



This section describes the behavior of `AUTO_INCREMENT` lock modes used to generate auto-increment values, and how each lock mode affects replication. Auto-increment lock modes are configured at startup using the `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode` configuration parameter.

The following terms are used in describing `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode` settings:

- “`INSERT`-like” statements

  All statements that generate new rows in a table, including `INSERT`. Includes “simple-inserts”, “bulk-inserts”, and “mixed-mode” inserts.

- “Simple inserts”

  Statements for which the number of rows to be inserted can be determined in advance (when the statement is initially processed). This includes single-row and multiple-row `INSERT`.

- “Bulk inserts”

  Statements for which the number of rows to be inserted (and the number of required auto-increment values) is not known in advance. This includes `INSERT ... SELECT` statements, but not plain `INSERT`. `InnoDB` assigns new values for the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column one at a time as each row is processed.

- “Mixed-mode inserts”

  These are “simple insert” statements that specify the auto-increment value for some (but not all) of the new rows. An example follows, where `c1` is an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column of table `t1`:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO t1 (c1,c2) VALUES (1,'a'), (NULL,'b'), (5,'c'), (NULL,'d');
  ```

  Another type of “mixed-mode insert” is `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`, where the allocated value for the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column may or may not be used during the update phase.

There are three possible settings for the `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode` configuration parameter. The settings are 0, 1, or 2, for “traditional”, “consecutive”, or “interleaved” lock mode, respectively.

- `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode = 0` (“traditional” lock mode)

  The traditional lock mode provides the same behavior that existed before the `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode` configuration parameter was introduced in MySQL 5.1. The traditional lock mode option is provided for backward compatibility, performance testing, and working around issues with “mixed-mode inserts”, due to possible differences in semantics.

  In this lock mode, all “INSERT-like” statements obtain a special table-level `AUTO-INC` lock for inserts into tables with `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns. This lock is normally held to the end of the statement (not to the end of the transaction) to ensure that auto-increment values are assigned in a predictable and repeatable order for a given sequence of `INSERT` statements, and to ensure that auto-increment values assigned by any given statement are consecutive.

  In the case of statement-based replication, this means that when an SQL statement is replicated on a replica server, the same values are used for the auto-increment column as on the source server. The result of execution of multiple `INSERT` statements would be nondeterministic, and could not reliably be propagated to a replica server using statement-based replication.

  To make this clear, consider an example that uses this table:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (
    c1 INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    c2 VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (c1)
  ) ENGINE=InnoDB;
  ```

  Suppose that there are two transactions running, each inserting rows into a table with an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column. One transaction is using an `INSERT ... SELECT` statement that inserts one row:

  ```sql
  Tx1: INSERT INTO t1 (c2) SELECT 1000 rows from another table ...
  Tx2: INSERT INTO t1 (c2) VALUES ('xxx');
  ```

  `InnoDB` cannot tell in advance how many rows are retrieved from the `SELECT` statement in Tx2 is either be smaller or larger than all those used for Tx1, depending on which statement executes first.

  As long as the SQL statements execute in the same order when replayed from the binary log (when using statement-based replication, or in recovery scenarios), the results are the same as they were when Tx1 and Tx2 first ran. Thus, table-level locks held until the end of a statement make `INSERT` statements using auto-increment safe for use with statement-based replication. However, those table-level locks limit concurrency and scalability when multiple transactions are executing insert statements at the same time.

  In the preceding example, if there were no table-level lock, the value of the auto-increment column used for the `INSERT` statements are nondeterministic, and may vary from run to run.

  Under the [consecutive]() lock mode, `InnoDB` can avoid using table-level `AUTO-INC` locks for “simple insert” statements where the number of rows is known in advance, and still preserve deterministic execution and safety for statement-based replication.

  If you are not using the binary log to replay SQL statements as part of recovery or replication, the [interleaved]() lock mode can be used to eliminate all use of table-level `AUTO-INC` locks for even greater concurrency and performance, at the cost of permitting gaps in auto-increment numbers assigned by a statement and potentially having the numbers assigned by concurrently executing statements interleaved.

- `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode = 1` (“consecutive” lock mode)

  This is the default lock mode. In this mode, “bulk inserts” use the special `AUTO-INC` table-level lock and hold it until the end of the statement. This applies to all `INSERT ... SELECT` statements. Only one statement holding the `AUTO-INC` lock can execute at a time. If the source table of the bulk insert operation is different from the target table, the `AUTO-INC` lock on the target table is taken after a shared lock is taken on the first row selected from the source table. If the source and target of the bulk insert operation are the same table, the `AUTO-INC` lock is taken after shared locks are taken on all selected rows.

  “Simple inserts” (for which the number of rows to be inserted is known in advance) avoid table-level `AUTO-INC` locks by obtaining the required number of auto-increment values under the control of a mutex (a light-weight lock) that is only held for the duration of the allocation process, *not* until the statement completes. No table-level `AUTO-INC` lock is used unless an `AUTO-INC` lock is held by another transaction. If another transaction holds an `AUTO-INC` lock, a “simple insert” waits for the `AUTO-INC` lock, as if it were a “bulk insert”.

  This lock mode ensures that, in the presence of `INSERT`-like” statement are consecutive, and operations are safe for statement-based replication.

  Simply put, this lock mode significantly improves scalability while being safe for use with statement-based replication. Further, as with “traditional” lock mode, auto-increment numbers assigned by any given statement are *consecutive*. There is *no change* in semantics compared to “traditional” mode for any statement that uses auto-increment, with one important exception.

  The exception is for “mixed-mode inserts”, where the user provides explicit values for an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column for some, but not all, rows in a multiple-row “simple insert”. For such inserts, `InnoDB` allocates more auto-increment values than the number of rows to be inserted. However, all values automatically assigned are consecutively generated (and thus higher than) the auto-increment value generated by the most recently executed previous statement. “Excess” numbers are lost.

- `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode = 2` (“interleaved” lock mode)

  In this lock mode, no “`INSERT`-like” statements use the table-level `AUTO-INC` lock, and multiple statements can execute at the same time. This is the fastest and most scalable lock mode, but it is *not safe* when using statement-based replication or recovery scenarios when SQL statements are replayed from the binary log.

  In this lock mode, auto-increment values are guaranteed to be unique and monotonically increasing across all concurrently executing “`INSERT`-like” statements. However, because multiple statements can be generating numbers at the same time (that is, allocation of numbers is *interleaved* across statements), the values generated for the rows inserted by any given statement may not be consecutive.

  If the only statements executing are “simple inserts” where the number of rows to be inserted is known ahead of time, there are no gaps in the numbers generated for a single statement, except for “mixed-mode inserts”. However, when “bulk inserts” are executed, there may be gaps in the auto-increment values assigned by any given statement.

##### InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT Lock Mode Usage Implications

- Using auto-increment with replication

  If you are using statement-based replication, set `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode` or configurations where the source and replicas do not use the same lock mode.

  If you are using row-based or mixed-format replication, all of the auto-increment lock modes are safe, since row-based replication is not sensitive to the order of execution of the SQL statements (and the mixed format uses row-based replication for any statements that are unsafe for statement-based replication).

- “Lost” auto-increment values and sequence gaps

  In all lock modes (0, 1, and 2), if a transaction that generated auto-increment values rolls back, those auto-increment values are “lost”. Once a value is generated for an auto-increment column, it cannot be rolled back, whether or not the “`INSERT`-like” statement is completed, and whether or not the containing transaction is rolled back. Such lost values are not reused. Thus, there may be gaps in the values stored in an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column of a table.

- Specifying NULL or 0 for the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column

  In all lock modes (0, 1, and 2), if a user specifies NULL or 0 for the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column in an `INSERT`, `InnoDB` treats the row as if the value was not specified and generates a new value for it.

- Assigning a negative value to the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column

  In all lock modes (0, 1, and 2), the behavior of the auto-increment mechanism is not defined if you assign a negative value to the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column.

- If the `AUTO_INCREMENT` value becomes larger than the maximum integer for the specified integer type

  In all lock modes (0, 1, and 2), the behavior of the auto-increment mechanism is not defined if the value becomes larger than the maximum integer that can be stored in the specified integer type.

- Gaps in auto-increment values for “bulk inserts”

  With `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`, the auto-increment values generated by any given statement are consecutive, without gaps, because the table-level `AUTO-INC` lock is held until the end of the statement, and only one such statement can execute at a time.

  With `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`-like” statements.

  For lock modes 1 or 2, gaps may occur between successive statements because for bulk inserts the exact number of auto-increment values required by each statement may not be known and overestimation is possible.

- Auto-increment values assigned by “mixed-mode inserts”

  Consider a “mixed-mode insert,” where a “simple insert” specifies the auto-increment value for some (but not all) resulting rows. Such a statement behaves differently in lock modes 0, 1, and 2. For example, assume `c1` is an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column of table `t1`, and that the most recent automatically generated sequence number is 100.

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
      -> c1 INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      -> c2 CHAR(1)
      -> ) ENGINE = INNODB;
  ```

  Now, consider the following “mixed-mode insert” statement:

  ```sql
  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 (c1,c2) VALUES (1,'a'), (NULL,'b'), (5,'c'), (NULL,'d');
  ```

  With `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`, the four new rows are:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 ORDER BY c2;
  +-----+------+
  | c1  | c2   |
  +-----+------+
  |   1 | a    |
  | 101 | b    |
  |   5 | c    |
  | 102 | d    |
  +-----+------+
  ```

  The next available auto-increment value is 103 because the auto-increment values are allocated one at a time, not all at once at the beginning of statement execution. This result is true whether or not there are concurrently executing “`INSERT`-like” statements (of any type).

  With `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`, the four new rows are also:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 ORDER BY c2;
  +-----+------+
  | c1  | c2   |
  +-----+------+
  |   1 | a    |
  | 101 | b    |
  |   5 | c    |
  | 102 | d    |
  +-----+------+
  ```

  However, in this case, the next available auto-increment value is 105, not 103 because four auto-increment values are allocated at the time the statement is processed, but only two are used. This result is true whether or not there are concurrently executing “`INSERT`-like” statements (of any type).

  With `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`, the four new rows are:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 ORDER BY c2;
  +-----+------+
  | c1  | c2   |
  +-----+------+
  |   1 | a    |
  |   x | b    |
  |   5 | c    |
  |   y | d    |
  +-----+------+
  ```

  The values of *`x`* and *`y`* are unique and larger than any previously generated rows. However, the specific values of *`x`* and *`y`* depend on the number of auto-increment values generated by concurrently executing statements.

  Finally, consider the following statement, issued when the most-recently generated sequence number is 100:

  ```sql
  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 (c1,c2) VALUES (1,'a'), (NULL,'b'), (101,'c'), (NULL,'d');
  ```

  With any `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`` fails.

- Modifying `AUTO_INCREMENT` column values in the middle of a sequence of `INSERT` statements

  In all lock modes (0, 1, and 2), modifying an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column value in the middle of a sequence of `INSERT` operations that do not specify an unused auto-increment value could encounter “Duplicate entry” errors. This behavior is demonstrated in the following example.

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
      -> c1 INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      -> PRIMARY KEY (c1)
      ->  ) ENGINE = InnoDB;

  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(0), (0), (3);

  mysql> SELECT c1 FROM t1;
  +----+
  | c1 |
  +----+
  |  1 |
  |  2 |
  |  3 |
  +----+

  mysql> UPDATE t1 SET c1 = 4 WHERE c1 = 1;

  mysql> SELECT c1 FROM t1;
  +----+
  | c1 |
  +----+
  |  2 |
  |  3 |
  |  4 |
  +----+

  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(0);
  ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '4' for key 'PRIMARY'
  ```

##### InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT Counter Initialization



This section describes how `InnoDB` initializes `AUTO_INCREMENT` counters.

If you specify an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column for an `InnoDB` table, the table handle in the `InnoDB` data dictionary contains a special counter called the auto-increment counter that is used in assigning new values for the column. This counter is stored only in main memory, not on disk.

To initialize an auto-increment counter after a server restart, `InnoDB` executes the equivalent of the following statement on the first insert into a table containing an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column.

```sql
SELECT MAX(ai_col) FROM table_name FOR UPDATE;
```

`InnoDB` increments the value retrieved by the statement and assigns it to the column and to the auto-increment counter for the table. By default, the value is incremented by 1. This default can be overridden by the `auto_increment_increment` configuration setting.

If the table is empty, `InnoDB` uses the value `1`. This default can be overridden by the `auto_increment_offset` configuration setting.

If a `SHOW TABLE STATUS` statement examines the table before the auto-increment counter is initialized, `InnoDB` initializes but does not increment the value. The value is stored for use by later inserts. This initialization uses a normal exclusive-locking read on the table and the lock lasts to the end of the transaction. `InnoDB` follows the same procedure for initializing the auto-increment counter for a newly created table.

After the auto-increment counter has been initialized, if you do not explicitly specify a value for an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column, `InnoDB` increments the counter and assigns the new value to the column. If you insert a row that explicitly specifies the column value, and the value is greater than the current counter value, the counter is set to the specified column value.

`InnoDB` uses the in-memory auto-increment counter as long as the server runs. When the server is stopped and restarted, `InnoDB` reinitializes the counter for each table for the first `INSERT` to the table, as described earlier.

A server restart also cancels the effect of the `AUTO_INCREMENT = *`N`*` table option in `CREATE TABLE` statements, which you can use with `InnoDB` tables to set the initial counter value or alter the current counter value.

##### Notes



- When an `AUTO_INCREMENT` integer column runs out of values, a subsequent `INSERT` operation returns a duplicate-key error. This is general MySQL behavior.
- When you restart the MySQL server, `InnoDB` may reuse an old value that was generated for an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column but never stored (that is, a value that was generated during an old transaction that was rolled back).
