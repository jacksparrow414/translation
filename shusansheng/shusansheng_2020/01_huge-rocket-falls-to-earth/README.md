# Huge Chinese Rocket Stage Falls to Earth in Uncontrolled Reentry

# 不受控制的大火箭折返坠回地球

China celebrated success last week when its prototype crewed spacecraft returned to Earth after several days in orbit. It got there with the aid of a new, more powerful rocket called the Long March 5B. The core stage remained in space until yesterday when it splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean. This was no piddly little chunk of space debris, though. The Chinese rocket stage was the largest uncontrolled reentry in decades.

The Long March 5B is China’s next-generation launch platform with a payload capacity slightly higher than the SpaceX Falcon 9. China hopes to use the new rocket to assemble a modular space station in orbit of Earth, so it weighed down the test capsule with extra fuel to simulate 20-ton station segments. The spacecraft returned to Earth safely last week, but the core stage rocket remained in space until yesterday when it plummeted uncontrolled to Earth.

Most space launches include the release of rocket stages over open ocean, or in the case of SpaceX, landed on a drone ship. Uncontrolled reentry of space debris is not uncommon, but the pieces are rarely as large as the 17.8-ton Long March stage. This was the largest uncontrolled reentry since the 39-ton Soviet Salyut 7 space station crashed to Earth in 1991.

中国上周庆祝成功，当时它的原型载人航天器在轨道上运行了几天后返回地球。它是借助新型的更强大的火箭（长征5B）到达那里的。核心舞台一直停留在太空中，直到昨天溅入大西洋。不过，这并不是一点点空间碎片。中国火箭级是几十年来最大的无节制重返。

长征5B号是中国的下一代发射平台，其有效载荷能力略高于SpaceX Falcon9。中国希望使用这枚新火箭在地球轨道上组装一个模块化空间站，因此它对测试舱的重量施加了额外的负担燃料以模拟20吨工位。该航天器上周安全返回地球，但核心级火箭一直呆在太空中，直到昨天它不受控制地坠落到地球上。

大多数太空发射都包括在公海中释放火箭级，或者在SpaceX的情况下，将其放到无人机上。不受控制地进入太空碎片的情况并不少见，但碎片很少像17.8吨长征阶段那样大。这是自1991年39吨重的苏联礼炮7号太空站撞向地球以来最大的一次不受控制的重返。

The odds of an unneeded satellite or rocket segment hitting anything important are small, but space agencies still try to drop them in the ocean via controlled reentry. China did plan for the booster to fall to Earth, but it didn’t know where. Its resting place turned out to be just off the coast of Africa, about 100 miles from Mauritania.

Astronomer Jonathan McDowell from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics says he’s never seen a major reentry pass over as many populated areas as the Long March 5B did. It even flew just 105 miles (170 kilometers) over New York City during its descent. Being an uncontrolled reentry, the Chinese government didn’t have any say over the course the stage took, but you could argue it was irresponsible to allow it to reenter the atmosphere without any plan.

China is moving aggressively to send astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit, and the recovery of its experimental capsule from a high orbit is a significant step in accomplishing that goal. We can expect more rocket segments to drop out of the sky as China continues its testing. Hopefully, they’re a bit more careful where the equipment drops, though.

不需要的卫星或火箭弹击中任何重要物体的几率很小，但太空机构仍试图通过控制性的重返过程将它们抛入海洋。中国确实计划将助推器降落到地球，但它不知道在哪里。原来它的安息之地就在非洲海岸附近，距毛里塔尼亚约100英里。

哈佛-史密森尼天体物理学中心的天文学家乔纳森·麦克道威尔说，他从未见过像大长征5B那样，有如此大规模的再入口越过人口稠密的地区。在下降期间，它甚至飞越纽约市仅105英里（170公里）。作为一个不受控制的重返市场，中国政府在这个阶段没有任何发言权，但是您可以辩称，让它在没有任何计划的情况下重新进入大气层是不负责任的。

中国正在积极采取行动，将宇航员送离低地球轨道，从高轨道上恢复其实验舱是实现这一目标的重要一步。我们可以预期，随着中国继续进行测试，更多的火箭弹将从天上掉下来。希望他们在设备掉落的地方更加谨慎。
